This repository contains microservices written using Kitex, with a focus on the intersection of users and videos. The services use ETCD for load balancing and currently aim to implement the following features:

1. Provide a video stream sorted in reverse chronological order by submission time.
2. Support user like vedio operation.
3. Support user query for all liked videos.
